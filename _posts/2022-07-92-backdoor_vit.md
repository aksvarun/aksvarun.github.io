We show that Vision Transformers are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Moreover, we find an intriguing difference between CNNs and Transformers where commonly used interpretation algorithms for CNN architectures are unable to highlight the backdoor trigger during test time, but Transformers achieve this quite easily. Based on this, we develop a test-time blocking defense which reduces attack success rates by a large margin.
