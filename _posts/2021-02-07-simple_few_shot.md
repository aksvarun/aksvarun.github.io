We develop a simple transfer-learning based algorithm to achieve adversarial robustness in Few-shot Image Classification. Such an approach bypasses the need for meta-learning based robustness methods, hence providing  advantages such as efficiency, simplicity, scalability etc. We also show that our framework can be used to develop verifiably robust networks for few-shot settings.
